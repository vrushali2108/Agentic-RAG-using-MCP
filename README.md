Agentic RAG Chatbot using Model Context Protocol (MCP)

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot with a modular agent-based architecture, where each agent (Ingestion, Retrieval, and LLM Response) communicates using structured Model Context Protocol (MCP) messages.
It supports answering questions based on multi-format uploaded documents (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, CSV, TXT/Markdown).
